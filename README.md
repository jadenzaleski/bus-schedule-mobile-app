## Vision 
A fully comprehensive, accessible bus scheduling application (available on both mobile and web-based platforms) that allows students and educators in Calabria to acquire accurate bus route information, view their location while traveling, while ultimately delivering them from one designated location to another in a safe and timely manner. 

## Mission
Our mission is to enhance and transform the way people experience public transportation. We aim to develop a bus scheduling application that provides real-time, accurate information on bus routes in Calabria. This application will allow users to access bus routes near them and will provide them with reliable, efficient, and usable data to assist them in travel around the city.

## Success Criteria
- The user is satisfied with the overall appearance and functionality of the application. They are also pleased with the application's dependability and its ability to run across multiple platforms.
- All information presented to the user regarding routes, stops, and schedules within the application is consistent and reliable.
- Once the application is finished, the assigned maintainer will have the capability to easily make updates, incorporate new features, and enhance functionality. Additionally, they will be able to promptly adapt the application to platform updates.

## Additional Information
Our main objectives are for our project to include the following functional capabilities:
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Users can access the bus scheduling application from either an internet browser or through a downloadable mobile application.
- **Route Generation** - Users will be able to pick a starting and end location, and a corresponding itinerary will be planned to get their chosen end location.
- **Visual Map Interface** - A geographical visual aid will be provided for users to track their location and progress while traveling on a provided route
- **Real-Time Updates** -  While using the app, students will be able to view live updates regarding various factors, such as bus status, potential delays, and steps needed to complete a chosen route.

The application’s scope will be limited to Calabria, a region in southern Italy. This is where Miami University’s computer science study-abroad program is located. The application should be able to perform all aforementioned functionality for this region of the country specifically.
